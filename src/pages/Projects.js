          <h4>A pet adoption mobile application</h4>

          <p>
            Shelter-in-Pets was built during the COVID-19 lockdown. My team and
            I wanted to build an application that helped people e-visit and
            adopt shelter dogs. The app matches user-uploaded dog images to
            similar adoptable dogs, allows a user to conduct filtered searches
            based on desired traits, and even recommends adoptable dogs based on
            the userâ€™s in-app activity.

          <p>
            Fascinated by image recognition technologies, I wanted to build an
            application that recognized uploaded images and generate relevant
            hashtags. The app was built using Flutter/Dart and Google Teachable
            Machine during a 4 day hackathon. While it was challenging to learn
            a new language and Tensorflow Lite in such a short period of time, I
            was pleased that I was able to incorporate a pretrained machine
            learning model and user login authentication flow in my mobile
            application.
